# React-Native-Props

## A React-Native Hybrid Application inside which I have used the concepts of React-Native Props & Components.

### In this application, I have learned:-
- Props in React-Native. 
- Different Components (Functional & Class).
- How to use another .js file (component) inside the main App.js file.
- How to use Image tag.
- require and uri property for the source attribute of the Image tag.
- Card tag from the package react-native-paper.
